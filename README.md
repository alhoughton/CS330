# CS330
Repo for my 3D Scene Final project for CS 330, Computer Graphics and Visualization, at SNHU

## How do I approach designing software?
When approaching the 3D scenes for this project it helped to create a visual representation on graph paper. I would label the axis and plot points. It made it easier to visualize where the vertices are my shapes are supposed to be.

When developing something that as a user interface, starting off with a rough drawing or picture of what you want that interface to look will help when it comes to coding that interface. So, in future work I'll be sure to sketch out anything that will be visually represented on the screen that I need to code.

## How do I approach developing programs?
First I look to see what similar programs have been created and how those were done. They typically will provide an example of a process that I need to use that I can then track down and figure out. A great resource for me was YouTube. I would spend a lot of time watching different YouTube videos that would explain a process that I needed to use in different ways to help me better understand it. Once I was able to understand how something worked and see examples of it working, I was able to then create my program based on that.

My approach evolved throughout the milestones as I better understood what we were doing. I could simplfy the code, utilizing a function that loads the textures which reduced the number of lines of code and made it easier to add additional textures. Each milestone allowed me to focus on one aspect of the overall project so that when I needed to add addtional objects it was a lot easier to code and create.

## How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
Computational graphics and visualization really forced me to get better at reading C++ code. Having to go through hundreds of lines of code to see what does what really reinforced concepts from previous courses. Also, each week I'd find myself struggling to figure out the concept. I wouldn't give up, though. I would use my resources, try different things, and ask questions until I was able to figure it out. It really helped me become a better problem solver which, really, is what computer science is all about.

While my overall goal doesn't include creating 3D objects, the problem solving skills and confidence in my abilities the class provided is something that will carry on into my future professional pathway. Getting through this class, which was probably the most difficult one I've had to do shows me that with perseverance and determination I can accomplish what I set my mind to.
